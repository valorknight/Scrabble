# Scrabble
This is a project to try recreate the famous board game "Scrabble"

This project uses the "tkinkter", "random" and "collections" module. 
  We use tkinkter for the GUI and associated parts of the project. 
  We use the defaultdict function from collections to create a dictionary without worrying about the "KeyError" function.

The code randomly gives the players letters to place on the 15x15 board from the pre-determined tile bag. The players are to make meaningful words using the letters and points will be allotted based on the Scrabble point system. The game goes on until one of the player's tile bag is completely emptied, on that instance the player with the most points will be declared the winner.
